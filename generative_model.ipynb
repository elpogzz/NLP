    "Earlier this year Adam Ellis shared illustrations he made for algorithm-generated Sanrio characters. He got the character's descriptions  from a voicebox keyboard trained with the character's wikipedia bios. I found the character descriptions to be too funny, so I decided to try and generate some of my own, but using a homebrew language model rather than using voicebox. Also, I decided to use a corpus made up of the 7th Gen Pokemon Pokedex entries because it seems like it would be [funnier](http://www.dorkly.com/post/81404/20-super-dark-pokedex-entries-from-pokemon-sun-and-moon). \n",
